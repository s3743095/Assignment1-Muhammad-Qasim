The IT sector offers fast work, opportunities in every sector, more career paths along with high salaries. Information technology is not a standalone industry, it overlaps with almost every other industry. From healthcare, Engineering to agriculture, IT is transforming all spheres of business which allows IT professionals to choose a career in accordance with their interest.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			My interest in computers started when my very first computer’s window crashed and corrupted all my data (in 2007). I took a challenge to repair my computer myself. I managed to install a new window (windows XP) but could not recover my data. Since then, I have been passionate about computers and IT. My main interest in IT sector is learning about AI and machine learning.

            </div>
			<h2 class="size-30">Overview</h2><br/>
			<p>Idea of the project is to make an App for people who have recently arrived in Australia specifically, Students and refugees. This App will have all the relevant information regarding Australia, its people, places to visit, food options, emergency contact details etc in their preferred language which they may find helpful during their stay.
			</p>
			<h2 class="size-30">Motivation</h2><br/>
			<p>Tens of thousands of students arrive in Australia to take courses in different universities around Australia. According to government figures, around 7000 international students arrived in country right after boarder opening. Demand for Australian study visa has also been strong with more than 50,000 applications lodged only in 2021.</p>

			</div> <br/>		
						
			<p>Similarly, Thousands of people are forced to flee their home country to find safe place to live. In the financial year of 2019-20, Australia granted refugee status to 14,993 people, either through resettlement from other countries or granting protection to people who had applied for asylum in Australia. From the data, we can see that there is a need to develop this kind of App which will help people in positive way and help provide necessary information to settle in Australia.

			</p>
			
			<h2 class="size-30">Description</h2><br/>
			<p>	A mobile App which will provide all the necessary information to its users. The main users of this app will be new students and refugees arriving in Australia with minimum to no English-speaking background. The App will be made in such a way that when a user install’s this app, it will prompt an option to select a language according to their choice. The idea behind this project is to provide the necessary information about Australia, its people, local emergency contact details (fire-brigade, Police, Ambulance), nearest hospitals, shopping malls, food points and much more. 
			</p>
			<h2 class="size-30">tools and Technologies </h2><br/>
			<p>	•	Computer system<br/>
				•	Mobile App builder platform (Android studio, MIT APP designer, Appery.io, AppMachine etc)

			</p>
			<h2 class="size-30">Skills Required</h2><br/>

				•	UI & UX Experience<br/>
				•	Graphic design<br/>
